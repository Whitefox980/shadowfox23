## 📊 Executive Summary

Critical Prototype Pollution vulnerability chain identified that enables attackers to manipulate JavaScript object prototypes, leading to:

**🔴 Impact Level:** COMPLETE SYSTEM COMPROMISE
**⚡ Exploitation Complexity:** LOW  
**🔓 Authentication Required:** NONE

## 🔍 Technical Details

**Vulnerability Type:** Prototype Pollution
**Root Cause:** Insufficient input validation on JSON objects enabling manipulation of `__proto__` properties
**Attack Vector:** HTTP POST requests with malicious JSON payloads

### 🎯 Proof of Concept Results


#### 1. Node.js Child Process RCE - 🔍 TESTED

- **Endpoint:** `https://uat-bugbounty.nonprod.syfe.com/api/user`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Payload:** `__proto__[shell]=true&__proto__[env][NODE_OPTIONS]=--inspect=0.0.0.0:9229`
- **CVSS Score:** `9.8`
- **Response Status:** `406`


## 🏢 Business Impact

**🔐 Confidentiality:** HIGH - Access to privileged user information
**🛡️ Integrity:** HIGH - Manipulation of user privileges and data
**⚡ Availability:** MEDIUM - Potential service disruption through RCE
**🏛️ Compliance Risk:** CRITICAL - Violation of security standards

## ⚡ Recommendations

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Implement input validation that blocks `__proto__` and constructor properties
2. **HIGH:** Use `Object.create(null)` or `Map` instead of plain objects for user input
3. **HIGH:** Implement JSON schema validation with whitelisting approach
4. **MEDIUM:** Code review of all JSON processing functions
5. **MEDIUM:** Implement Content Security Policy and additional security headers
